1.	Init
The git init command initialises a local repository on my computer and allows me to work on it on my PC. After executing ‘init’, the repo will be in sub folder of where I ran the ‘init’ command. (hidden git folder)
 
 
2.	Add 
The git add command can make files or whole directories staged for committing to repositories.
 
3. Status 
Status indicates the current contents of the local repo and their current state (eg. Whether staged, dirty, etc).
 
4.	Commit 
Creates a new commit with files that have been staged. The new commit is the child of the head, I think.
 
5.	Remote 
Manages the repos associated with the project, allows you to see what you’re currently attached to (‘master’) – does a lot more stuff!
 
6.	Push 
Updates the remote node with the current node – sends staged files/commits to remote repo.
 
7.	Branch
Branch allows the user to list created branches, make a new branch or delete branches. (Doesn’t switch to ‘em?)

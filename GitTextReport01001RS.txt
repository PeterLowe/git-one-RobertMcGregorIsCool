1.	Init
The git init command initialises a local repository on my computer and allows me to work on it on my PC. After executing ‘init’, the repo will be in sub folder of where I ran the ‘init’ command. (hidden git folder). You may need to enter the working dir with the CD command. I can’t seem to use the dir/w command, so it looks like I’ll have to relearn some stuff…! 
 
 
2.	Add 
The git add command can make files or whole directories staged for committing to repositories.
 
3. Status 
Status indicates the current contents of the local repo and their current state (eg. Whether staged, dirty, etc).
 
4.	Commit 
Creates a new commit with files that have been staged. The new commit is the child of the head, I think.
 
5.	Remote 
Manages the repos associated with the project, allows you to see what you’re currently attached to (‘master’) – does a lot more stuff!
 
6.	Push 
Updates the remote node with the current node – sends staged files/commits to remote repo.
 
7.	Branch
Branch allows the user to list created branches, make a new branch or delete branches. (Doesn’t switch to ‘em?)
 
8.	Checkout 
 
Checkout makes my node (El Hefe Bastardo) the current HEAD. Then I switched back to MASTER as all my work had disappeared (wrong branch).
9.	Merge
Incorporates changes from El_Hefe_Bastardo into the current branch (Master). As El_Hefe_Bastardo has no major advances on Master, git reports that the Master branch is already up to date.
  
10.	Log 
Lists the commit logs , can be navigated with <space> and <q>.
 
11. Clone 
12. Pull 
13. Stash 
14. Rm
